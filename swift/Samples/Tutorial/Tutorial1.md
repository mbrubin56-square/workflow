# Step 1

_Let's get something on the screen..._

## Setup

Start by getting the project set up, by running `bundle exec pod gen` in `Samples/WorkflowWorkshop` to get the cocoapods installed.

Then, open `gen/WorkflowWorkshop/WorkflowWorkshop.xcworkspace` and run the target `WorkflowWorkshop-AppHost` to ensure that it builds.

The `Tutorial` pod in `Frameworks` will be our starting place to build from.

The welcome screen should look like:

![Welcome](images/welcome.png)

You can enter a name, but the login button won't do anything.

## First Workflow

Let's start by making a workflow and screen to back the welcome view.

First, start by creating a new workflow and screen by creating a new file with the xcode templates, adding it to the `Tutorial` target:

![New Workflow](images/new-workflow.png)
![Workflow Name](images/workflow-name.png)

And the same steps for the screen view controller. We can delete the `WelcomeSampleViewController.swift` file in the base tutorial, as we'll be replacing it.

### Screens and View Controllers

First, let's start with what a `screen` is, and how it relates to the view controller.

The `screen` protocol is a simple marker protocol, intended to describe the view model that will be used to drive a view controller.

For out welcome screen, let's define what it needs for a backing view model:
```swift
struct WelcomeScreen: Screen {
    /// The current name that has been entered.
    var name: String
    /// Callback when the name changes in the UI.
    var onNameChanged: (String) -> Void
    /// Callback when the login button is tapped.
    var onLoginTapped: () -> Void
}
```

First, let's add the convenient `WelcomeView` to our view controller (if you would like to create and layout the view yourself, feel free to do it!). Add a `welcomeView` property to the view controller, and add and lay it out in `viewDidLoad` and `viewDidLayoutSubviews` respectively.
```swift
// Import the `TutorialViews` module for the `WelcomeView`
import TutorialViews

final class WelcomeViewController: ScreenViewController<WelcomeScreen> {
    var welcomeView: WelcomeView

    required init(screen: WelcomeScreen, viewRegistry: ViewRegistry) {
        self.welcomeView = WelcomeView(frame: .zero)
        super.init(screen: screen, viewRegistry: viewRegistry)
        update(with: screen)
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        view.addSubview(welcomeView)
    }

    override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {
        super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()

        welcomeView.frame = view.bounds.inset(by: view.safeAreaInsets)
    }
```

The screen is passed into the view controller when it is initialized, as well as `screenDidChange` being called anytime the back screen is updated. The template provides a single method to handle updates to the screen, so let's fill that in now:
```swift
    private func update(with screen: WelcomeScreen) {
        /// Update UI
        welcomeView.name = screen.name
        welcomeView.onNameChanged = screen.onNameChanged
        welcomeView.onLoginTapped = screen.onLoginTapped
    }
```

Now, any time the screen is updated, the `WelcomeViewController` will update the `name` and `onNameChanged` fields on the `WelcomeView`. We can't quite run yet, as we still need to fill in the basics of our workflow.

### Workflows and Rendering Type

The core responsibility of a workflow is to provide a "rendering" every time the state updates. Let's go into the `WelcomeWorkflow` now, and have it return a `WelcomeScreen` in the `render` method.

```swift
// MARK: Rendering

extension WelcomeWorkflow {
    typealias Rendering = WelcomeScreen

    func render(state: WelcomeWorkflow.State, context: RenderContext<WelcomeWorkflow>) -> Rendering {
        return WelcomeScreen(
            name: "",
            onNameChanged: { _ in
            },
            onLoginTapped: {
            })
    }
}
```

### Setting up the ContainerViewController

Now, we have our `WelcomeWorkflow` rendering a `WelcomeScreen`, and have a view controller that knows how to display with a `WelcomeScreen`. It's time to bind this all together, and get it displaying.

We'll update the `TutorialContainerViewController` to hold a child *ContainerViewController* that will host our workflow:

```swift
import UIKit
import Workflow
import WorkflowUI


public final class TutorialContainerViewController: UIViewController {
    let containerViewController: UIViewController

    public init() {
        // Create a view registry. This will allow the infrastructure to map `Screen` types to their respective view controller type.
        var viewRegistry = ViewRegistry()
        // Register the `WelcomeScreen` and view controller with the convenience method the template provided.
        viewRegistry.registerWelcomeScreen()

        // Create a `ContainerViewController` with the `WelcomeWorkflow` as the root workflow, with the view registry we just created.
        containerViewController = ContainerViewController(
            workflow: WelcomeWorkflow(),
            viewRegistry: viewRegistry)

        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }
```

We did a few things here.
- First, we created a *view registry* that is used to map screen types to view controllers. The view registry is used by the container to determine what view controller to instantiate the first time we see a screen.
- Then, we registered our `WelcomeScreen` with the view registry so we have that mapping.
- Finally, we create our *ContainerViewController* with the WelcomeWorkflow as the root.

We can finally run the app again! It will look the exact same as before, but now powered by our workflow.

## Driving the UI from Workflow State

Right now, the workflow isn't handling any of the events from the UI. Let's update it to be responsible for the login name as well as the action when the login button is pressed.

### State

All workflows have a `State` type that represents the internal state of the workflow. This should be all of the data that this workflow is _responsible_ for - usually corresponds to the state for the UI.

We will model the first part of state that we want to track, the login `name`. Update the `State` type to include a name. We will also need to update `makeInitialState` to give an initial value:
```swift
// MARK: State and Initialization

extension WelcomeWorkflow {

    struct State {
        var name: String
    }

    func makeInitialState() -> WelcomeWorkflow.State {
        return State(name: "")
    }

    // ...
```

Now that we have the state modelled, we'll send it to the UI every time a render pass happens - the text field will overwrite it's value with whatever was provided.

```swift
// MARK: Rendering

extension WelcomeWorkflow {

    typealias Rendering = WelcomeScreen

    func render(state: WelcomeWorkflow.State, context: RenderContext<WelcomeWorkflow>) -> Rendering {
        return WelcomeScreen(
            name: state.name,
            onNameChanged: { _ in
            },
            onLoginTapped: {
            })
    }
}
```

If you run the app again, you'll see that it still behaves the same letting your type into the name field. This is because we only have rendered a screen once.

Now, to update our internal state, we need to add an "Action":

### Actions

Actions define how a workflow handled events received from the outside world, like UI, network requests, data stores, etc. Generally an `Action` type is an enum which make it easy to define all of the actions that this workflow will handle.

First, add a case to the existing `Action` called `nameChanged` to update our internal state:
```swift
// MARK: Actions

extension WelcomeWorkflow {

    enum Action: WorkflowAction {

        typealias WorkflowType = WelcomeWorkflow

        case nameChanged(name: String)

        func apply(toState state: inout WelcomeWorkflow.State) -> WelcomeWorkflow.Output? {

            switch self {

            case .nameChanged(name: let name):
                // Update our state with the updated name.
                state.name = name
                // Return nothing for the output, we want to handle this action only at the level of this workflow.
                return nil
            }
        }
    }

}
```

Finally, we need to send this action back to the workflow any time the name changes. Update the `render` method to send it through a sink back to the workflow whenever the `onNameChanged` closure is called:

```swift
// MARK: Rendering

extension WelcomeWorkflow {

    typealias Rendering = WelcomeScreen

    func render(state: WelcomeWorkflow.State, context: RenderContext<WelcomeWorkflow>) -> Rendering {
        // Create a "sink" of type `Action`. A sink is what we use to send actions to the workflow.
        let sink = context.makeSink(of: Action.self)

        return WelcomeScreen(
            name: state.name,
            onNameChanged: { name in
                sink.send(.nameChanged(name: name))
            },
            onLoginTapped: {
            })
    }
}
```

### The update loop

If we run the app again, it will still behave the same but we are now capturing the name changes in our workflow's state, as well as having the UI show the name based upon the workflows internal state.

To see this, change the `apply` method to suffix a letter on the name received, eg:
```swift
        func apply(toState state: inout WelcomeWorkflow.State) -> WelcomeWorkflow.Output? {

            switch self {
            case .nameChanged(name: let name):
                // Update our state with the updated name.
                state.name = name + "a"
                // Return nothing for the output, we want to handle this action only at the level of this workflow.
                return nil
            }
        }
```

Running the app again will have the name field suffixed with a letter 'a' on every keypress. We probably want to undo this change, but it demonstrates that the UI is being updated from the internal state.

Here is what is happening on each keypress:
1) The UI called `onNameChanged` whenever the contents of the text field change.
2) The closure calls `sink.send(.nameChanged(name: name)`, which sends an action to be handled by the workflow.
3) The `apply` method on the action is called. The `state` parameter is an `inout` parameter, so when it is updated in `apply`, it updates the actual state.
    - This is effectively the same as this method being written `func apply(fromState: State) -> (State, Output?)` where it transforms the previous state into a new state.
4) As an action was just handled, the workflow must now be re-rendered so the `Screen` (and from it, the UI) can be updated.
    - `render` is called on the workflow. A new screen is returned with the updated `name` from the internal state.
5) The view controller is provided the new screen with the call to `func screenDidChange(from previousScreen: WelcomeScreen)`. Generally, the update is handled in the convenience method on the template of `private func update(with screen: WelcomeScreen)`.
    - This view controller updates the text field with the received name value, and also updates the callbacks for when the name changes or login is pressed.
6) The workflow waits for the next Action to be received, and then the goes through the same update loop.

# Summary

In this tutorial, we covered creating a Screen, ScreenViewController, Workflow, and binding them together in a ContainerViewController. We also covered the Workflow being responsible for the state of the UI instead of the view controller being responsible.

Next, we will create a second screen and workflow, and the use composition to navigate between  them.
